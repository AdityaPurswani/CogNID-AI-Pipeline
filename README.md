# AI-Driven Pipeline for Analysis and Classification of Neurodegenerative Diseases from Cognitive, Imaging, and Clinical Biomarkers


Neurodegenerative disorders(ND) such as Alzheimer's Dementia(AD) and Fronto-Temporal Dementia(FTD) present significant challenges in early diagnosis. The Cognitive and Neuroimaging in Neurodegenerative Disorders(CogNID) study provides a comprehensive dataset of 450 patients, including cognitive evaluations, MRI-scans, and clinical biomarkers. Our research develops an AI-driven framework for early detection of dementia by integrating multimodal data.

Our comprehensive AI-driven methodology integrates both MRI data and clinical text-reports to analyse neurodegenerative disorders. MRI-scans are processed to extract volumetric data from brain-structures affected by neurodegeneration. Initially, FSL's-BET tool performs skull stripping to precisely remove non-brain tissues. The resulting brain extractions undergo intensity normalization to standardize voxel data addressing inter-scanner variability common in clinical datasets. Bias-field correction follows using FSL's-FAST algorithm to eliminate intensity non-uniformities. These pre-processed images are registered to the standard MNI152 template using ANTs'-SyN transformation ensuring structural consistency across scans for improved analysis.

Atlas-based segmentation is applied on these scans leveraging Harvard-Oxford cortical/subcortical atlases identifying 27 brain regions implicated in neurodegeneration, particularly focusing on structures like the hippocampus. From these segmented regions, the system computes multiple quantitative biomarkers: volumetric measurements using efficient integral image approaches, surface area calculations, and advanced shape descriptors including compactness, sphericity, and eccentricity.

The system processes radiology reports using an NLP pipeline based on PubMedBERT, leveraging domain-specific embeddings for medical text analysis. Text-processing includes context-aware tokenization, medical-entity recognition, and dependency parsing to understand negations and syntactic relationships to extract relevant context for analyses. BART-based classifiers generate initial risk contexts, which are further refined through clustering and severity rating. K-means clustering (k=3) identifies report similarity patterns, and final risk scores are computed as a weighted sum of severity and cluster-risk. The model employs stacked transformer blocks with 4-head attention to analyse complex clinical language, ensuring robust contextual understanding. Training results demonstrated stable learning with consistent loss reduction across multiple epochs, enhancing risk assessment accuracy ensuring successful development of the pipeline.

To handle missing data, I implemented a class-aware KNN imputation that preserves the distinctive patterns of different diagnostic groups. The system first analyses inter-class similarities through normalized Euclidean distances between class feature means, creating a similarity matrix. KNN imputation (k=5) is applied separately within each diagnostic class. For classes with insufficient samples, the system implements a fallback strategy: first attempting KNN with similar diagnostic classes using the similarity matrix with a variation factor, otherwise using distribution-based generation, and finally leveraging global statistics with increased variation factors to reflect greater uncertainty.

The classification model utilizes XG-Boost optimized through 5-fold cross-validation to mitigate overfitting. Currently trained on the components of ACE-III assessment and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, the model addresses data imbalance through ADASYN with adjusted neighbourhood parameters. While this implementation focuses on cognitive and clinical features, the architecture is designed to seamlessly integrate multimodal neuroimaging biomarkers currently under development. Additionally, a documentation website an MRI classification platform are being developed as e-learning tools to promote the learning and development of more such diagnostic pipelines. 

The current implementation demonstrates strong performance in classifying neurodegenerative disorders based on cognitive and clinical phenotyping  achieving an accuracy of 91.67% with an AUC score of 0.9802. Analysis revealed certain cognitive measures as particularly valuable predictors with p-tau being the most important feature. Further development include the integration of multimodal data to access the feature importance of brain parts for diagnosis.

This study advances AI applications to support early diagnosis of ND by addressing medical data imbalance, robust model development, and ensuring model interpretability and scalability. This framework can support a relevant and precise diagnosis of dementia, important for further research on patients' diagnoses.
